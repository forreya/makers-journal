# Week 1

#### Weekly Aims:
1. Learn the basics of test driven development (TDD)
2. Gain experience building programs as a pair (driver-navigator) 
3. Understanding the best practices to debugging programs that contain errors.

#### Weekly Objectives:
1. Work through the 'Testing Bytes' section (TTD).
2. Individually debug 3 programs from the 'Skills Challenges'.
3. Begin making a document outlying reasons why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.
4. Everyday, spend the afternoon pairing with another person to work through the 'Golden Square' challenges (implementing practices such as driver-navigator pairing, pushing to/pulling from repositories, utilizing the 'Live Share' extension on VS Code)
