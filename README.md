## Makers Portfolio

Documenting my journey through Makers Academy's 16 week Software Development course.

### **What this repository will include:**
- Completed Challenges 
- New concepts, ideas, and methods that I learn
- My projects and the processes implemented to reach specific goals

### Understanding the Layout of Week.md files
*Each Week.md file will contain several sections to consolidate all my targets, achievements & learning in general.*
1. Aims - Usually written in broad statements, listing out what I had hoped to achieve by the end of the week. This involved any skills, concepts, methods of coding, etc that I wanted to learn/improve at.
2. Objectives - Specific targets I had accomplished to achieve my weekly aims. Usually consisting of measurable outcomes or steps that were taken to achieve the desired outcome.
3. Evidence - Links/Descriptions of the completed (or semi-completed) projects/challenges/exercises. Gives a rough run-down of what I did.
4. End-of-Week Evaluation - Analyses the week. What went well, what could have been done better, were all the aims achieved?, etc.

### **Concepts & Programming Methods Learned**
1. Test Driven Development (TDD)
2. Pair Programming (driver-navigator pairing, pushing/pulling from github, etc)
